      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Relationship Self-Assessment Tests! Our mission is to provide 
        accessible tools for individuals and couples to gain deeper insights into 
        their relationships and personal interaction styles.
      </p>
      <p>
        We currently offer assessments based on well-established frameworks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The 5 Love LanguagesÂ®:</strong> Understand how you and your partner prefer to give and receive love.</li>
        <li><strong>Attachment Theory:</strong> Explore your attachment style and how it influences your connections with others.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These tests are designed to be informative and thought-provoking, serving 
        as a starting point for self-reflection and better communication. We also 
        provide curated resources to further your understanding of these important 
        relationship dynamics.
