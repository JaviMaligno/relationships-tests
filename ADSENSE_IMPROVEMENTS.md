# AdSense Approval Improvement Plan

This document outlines suggested improvements to the Relationship Self-Assessment Tests application (https://relationships-tests.vercel.app/) to increase the likelihood of AdSense approval, based on common rejection reasons.

## 1. Increase Original Textual Content

**Goal:** Address potential "Insufficient Content" and "Content Quality" issues by adding substantial unique text. [Reference: Insufficient Content](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/81904?hl=es&ref_topic=1391540&sjid=15752995634416544926-EU#insufficient_content), [Reference: Quality Issues](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/81904?hl=es&ref_topic=1391540&sjid=15752995634416544926-EU#content_quality_issues)

* [X] **Expand Resources Tab:**
  * [X] Instead of just links, write original summaries/articles for each resource topic. (Done)
  * [X] Add introductory text explaining the importance of these resources. (Done)
  * [ ] Consider adding blog-style posts related to relationship topics.
* [X] **Add Test Introductions:**
  * [X] Write a detailed introduction paragraph before the Love Languages test explaining the theory, its origin, and purpose.
  * [X] Write a detailed introduction paragraph before the Attachment Styles test explaining the theory, its origin, and purpose.
* [X] **Enhance Test Results Pages:**
  * [X] Provide detailed, original descriptions for each possible Love Language result, including implications and relationship tips.
  * [X] Provide detailed, original descriptions for each possible Attachment Style result, including implications and relationship tips.
  * [X] Ensure the analysis goes beyond generic definitions and offers unique insights.

## 2. Ensure Content Uniqueness

**Goal:** Avoid potential "Content Policy Violations" related to duplicate content. [Reference: Policy Violations](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/81904?hl=es&ref_topic=1391540&sjid=15752995634416544926-EU#content_policy_violations)

* [X] Review test questions: If standard questions are used, ensure the surrounding content (introductions, results analysis) provides significant added value.
* [X] Verify resource summaries/articles are originally written and not copied from other sources.

## 3. Add Standard Informational Pages

**Goal:** Increase site credibility and provide necessary information often expected by AdSense and users.

* [X] **Create "About Us" Page:** Explain the site's mission, purpose, and potentially the creators. (Done)
* [X] **Create "Privacy Policy" Page:** Detail how user data (if any) is handled. Even if no data is explicitly collected, a basic policy is good practice. (Done)
* [X] **Create "Contact Us" Page:** Provide a way for users to get in touch. (Done)
* [X] Add links to these new pages in the site footer. (Done)

## 4. Refine User Experience & Navigation

**Goal:** Ensure the site is professional, easy to use, and technically sound. [Reference: Navigation Issues](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/81904?hl=es&ref_topic=1391540&sjid=15752995634416544926-EU#site_navigation_issues)

* [X] **Check All Links:** Ensure all internal and external links (especially in Resources) are working correctly.
* [X] **Test Functionality:** Thoroughly test both quizzes on different devices/browsers to ensure they work smoothly.
* [X] **Review Presentation:** Ensure results are clearly presented and the site looks polished and complete.
* [X] **Add Footer:** Ensure a consistent footer is present on all views, containing copyright information and links to standard pages (About, Privacy, Contact).
* [X] **Randomize Question Options:** Shuffle the order of options for each question in the tests to make them less predictable and improve user engagement. (Done)

## 5. Review Traffic Sources

**Goal:** Ensure traffic generation methods comply with AdSense policies. [Reference: Traffic Sources](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/81904?hl=es&ref_topic=1391540&sjid=15752995634416544926-EU#issues_with_your_traffic_sources)

* [X] Confirm no prohibited traffic generation methods (paid-to-click, spam, etc.) are being used. Focus on organic search, quality content promotion, and legitimate social media sharing.

## 6. Strengthen E-E-A-T (Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)

While AdSense technically focuses on policy compliance, many recent rejections cite "low-value content" – a criterion that overlaps with Google Search quality signals such as E-E-A-T. Relationship advice is considered "YMYL" (Your Money or Your Life) content, so demonstrating expertise and trust is crucial.

*   [ ] **Author Bios:** Add a short bio (with photo) for each content author on the About page or at the end of articles. Briefly list credentials, education, or relevant experience in psychology, counseling, or relationship coaching.
*   [ ] **Citations & References:** Where appropriate, cite reputable sources (academic papers, books, well-known psychology sites) and link to them from articles.
*   [ ] **External Validation:** If authors hold certifications or are members of professional organizations, mention and link to them.

## 7. Add Disclaimer & Terms of Service

*   [X] **Medical / Mental-Health Disclaimer:** Clearly state the tests are for educational purposes and not a substitute for professional diagnosis or therapy.
*   [X] **Terms of Service (TOS):** Create a Terms page outlining user responsibilities, intellectual property notice, and limitations of liability.
*   [X] **Link Footer:** Add prominent footer links for **Terms** and **Disclaimer** (can be combined with Privacy Policy).

## 8. Expand Static, Crawlable Content

AdSense reviewers and crawlers may *not* interact with the quizzes, so most of your rich content is hidden. Provide crawlable pages that stand on their own.

*   [X] **Create Dedicated Pages (≈600-1000 words each):** (Basic structure created)
    *   [X] Love Languages Overview (static page, separate from the quiz intro)
    *   [X] Individual Love Language pages (one per language, deep-dive content; inter-link them)
    *   [X] Attachment Styles Overview page
    *   [X] Individual Attachment Style pages (one per style)
    *   [X] FAQ page (common questions about the tests & relationship theories)
*   [X] **Internal Linking:** Link these articles from the Resources tab and from each other. (Initial links added)
*   [X] **Sitemap.xml:** Generate and serve a sitemap so AdSense reviewers can easily discover all pages. (Generated and linked in robots.txt)

## 9. Improve On-Page SEO / Meta Tags

*   [ ] Use React Helmet (or @tanstack/react-helmet-async) to set a unique `<title>` and `<meta description>` per route.
*   [ ] Add canonical URLs to prevent duplicate content signals.

## 10. Accessibility & UX Polish

*   [ ] Ensure all interactive elements have `aria-label`s and accessible color contrast.
*   [ ] Provide `alt` text for any images (e.g., logos, future blog images).
*   [ ] Add a custom 404 page with helpful navigation links.

## 11. AdSense Technical Checks

*   [X] **Single AdSense Script:** Verify the AdSense `<script>` is only injected once site-wide.
*   [X] **Ad Placeholder:** Add at least one responsive ad unit in visible content (e.g., inside articles) so reviewers see how ads will appear.
*   [X] **Ads.txt:** If hosting on a custom domain in the future, create an `ads.txt` file at the root listing your publisher ID.

## 12. Performance & Mobile Friendliness

*   [ ] Audit Core Web Vitals (use Lighthouse). Aim for "good" scores on mobile.
*   [ ] Use lazy loading for heavy assets and charts.

**Next Steps**: Complete the unchecked items above, then re-submit for AdSense approval. Many publishers report approval after adding crawlable static content and a clear disclaimer/terms page.
