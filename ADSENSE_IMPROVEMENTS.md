# AdSense Approval Improvement Plan

This document outlines suggested improvements to the Relationship Self-Assessment Tests application (https://relationships-tests.vercel.app/) to increase the likelihood of AdSense approval, based on common rejection reasons.

## 1. Increase Original Textual Content

**Goal:** Address potential "Insufficient Content" and "Content Quality" issues by adding substantial unique text. [Reference: Insufficient Content](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/81904?hl=es&ref_topic=1391540&sjid=15752995634416544926-EU#insufficient_content), [Reference: Quality Issues](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/81904?hl=es&ref_topic=1391540&sjid=15752995634416544926-EU#content_quality_issues)

* [X] **Expand Resources Tab:**
  * [X] Instead of just links, write original summaries/articles for each resource topic. (Done)
  * [X] Add introductory text explaining the importance of these resources. (Done)
  * [ ] Consider adding blog-style posts related to relationship topics.
* [X] **Add Test Introductions:**
  * [X] Write a detailed introduction paragraph before the Love Languages test explaining the theory, its origin, and purpose.
  * [X] Write a detailed introduction paragraph before the Attachment Styles test explaining the theory, its origin, and purpose.
* [X] **Enhance Test Results Pages:**
  * [X] Provide detailed, original descriptions for each possible Love Language result, including implications and relationship tips.
  * [X] Provide detailed, original descriptions for each possible Attachment Style result, including implications and relationship tips.
  * [X] Ensure the analysis goes beyond generic definitions and offers unique insights.

## 2. Ensure Content Uniqueness

**Goal:** Avoid potential "Content Policy Violations" related to duplicate content. [Reference: Policy Violations](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/81904?hl=es&ref_topic=1391540&sjid=15752995634416544926-EU#content_policy_violations)

* [X] Review test questions: If standard questions are used, ensure the surrounding content (introductions, results analysis) provides significant added value.
* [X] Verify resource summaries/articles are originally written and not copied from other sources.

## 3. Add Standard Informational Pages

**Goal:** Increase site credibility and provide necessary information often expected by AdSense and users.

* [X] **Create "About Us" Page:** Explain the site's mission, purpose, and potentially the creators. (Done)
* [X] **Create "Privacy Policy" Page:** Detail how user data (if any) is handled. Even if no data is explicitly collected, a basic policy is good practice. (Done)
* [X] **Create "Contact Us" Page:** Provide a way for users to get in touch. (Done)
* [X] Add links to these new pages in the site footer. (Done)

## 4. Refine User Experience & Navigation

**Goal:** Ensure the site is professional, easy to use, and technically sound. [Reference: Navigation Issues](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/81904?hl=es&ref_topic=1391540&sjid=15752995634416544926-EU#site_navigation_issues)

* [X] **Check All Links:** Ensure all internal and external links (especially in Resources) are working correctly.
* [X] **Test Functionality:** Thoroughly test both quizzes on different devices/browsers to ensure they work smoothly.
* [X] **Review Presentation:** Ensure results are clearly presented and the site looks polished and complete.
* [X] **Add Footer:** Ensure a consistent footer is present on all views, containing copyright information and links to standard pages (About, Privacy, Contact).

## 5. Review Traffic Sources

**Goal:** Ensure traffic generation methods comply with AdSense policies. [Reference: Traffic Sources](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/81904?hl=es&ref_topic=1391540&sjid=15752995634416544926-EU#issues_with_your_traffic_sources)

* [X] Confirm no prohibited traffic generation methods (paid-to-click, spam, etc.) are being used. Focus on organic search, quality content promotion, and legitimate social media sharing.
