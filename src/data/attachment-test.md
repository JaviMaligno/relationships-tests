Below is an original self‐assessment test designed to help you discover your attachment style in romantic relationships. For each question, choose the option that best describes your typical reactions or behaviors with your partner. There are no “right” or “wrong” answers—this test is solely intended to offer insights into your personal relationship patterns.

Attachment styles are generally grouped into four categories:

- **Secure:** Comfortable with intimacy and trust; you enjoy balanced closeness.
- **Anxious (Preoccupied):** You crave closeness but often worry about being abandoned or not being enough.
- **Avoidant (Dismissive):** You value independence and can feel uneasy with too much closeness or dependence.
- **Disorganized (Fearful):** You experience conflicting feelings, sometimes wanting intimacy and at other times fearing it.
